# selfoss

[selfoss](http://selfoss.aditu.de/) is a new multipurpose rss reader, live stream, mashup, aggregation web application.

This Dockerfile provides a selfoss image and was forked from [JensErat/docker-selfoss](http://archive.is/zlvS4), a PR [(#6)](http://archive.is/slBSz) was made to detail why the Docker BP are not respected as this image embeds the `cron` update.

For details on how to run the image, see the [archived/original README.md](http://archive.is/zlvS4).
